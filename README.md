# Mongoose Development Database

Provides a development database populated with sample data (currently empty). 

The database can be automatically retrieved and imported by Docker from the principal Mongoose repository: https://github.com/mongoose-project/mongoose. Please refer to the [Mongoose README](https://github.com/mongoose-project/mongoose) for instructions on the configuration necessary to do this.
