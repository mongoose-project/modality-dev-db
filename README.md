# Mongoose Development Database

Provides a development database populated with sample data (currently empty). 

The database can be manually imported into the principal [Mongoose](https://github.com/mongoose-project/mongoose) repository. Please refer to the [Mongoose README](https://github.com/mongoose-project/mongoose) for instructions on the configuration necessary to do this.
